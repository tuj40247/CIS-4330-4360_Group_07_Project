# Project Title: Smart Camera

Group Number: 7
Name: Joshua Hylton (tuj40247@temple.edu)

# Sensor:
•	Motion Sensor (front-facing camera or rear-facing camera)

# Abstract:
Camera systems can be expensive to set up and not easily available to everyone unlike with a smartphone many consumers have access to them. With the Smart Camera people can use their already available smartphone to function as a motion sensing camera using the camera module already on the phone. All it needs to function is a functioning front facing camera or rear facing camera to detect motion in the set area.

# Scenario:
This targets people who would like to use a camera system without breaking the bank to get standalone cameras. This is where the use of Smart Camera comes in to be a more affordable substitute to an actual camera system which can be readily available to the average consumer. A lot of people carry phones with them and even older phones they aren’t using so rather than them collecting dust put the to use and get an affordable motion sensing camera going.
