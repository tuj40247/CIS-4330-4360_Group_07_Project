# Project Title: Luminance Detection

Group Number: 7
Name: Joshua Hylton (tuj40247@temple.edu)

# Sensor:
•	•	Luminance Sensor

# Abstract:
Lux Light meters can cost anywhere starting around $20 and reads the current luminance in a room. I figured why pay unnecessary money when you can just use what your smartphone already has the capabilities of doing. With my LHT Sensor it will allow you to do this same action through the convenience of your phone.

# Scenario:
After thinking about this project for a while my idea was thinking of ways people like contractors who may need to find the light level of a room to figure out where to position light fixtures. I also figured that this is a useful feature to use in photography. I personally enjoy photography and light can play a huge factor in getting the shot you want. With a full rig of light setups, it would be important to know the luminance of the scene or shot being taken and having your phone be able to give.
